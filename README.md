# gwt - a Git worktree wrapper

`gwt` is a Bash function to make working with [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) a little easier. It provides functionality for listing all existing worktress, creating new worktrees, removing stale worktrees, and automates updating a worktree upon entering it.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`GWT_REPO_HOME`

## Usage/Examples

### Set up / Configuration

1. Tell `gwt` where your Git repos live
```sh
~ $ export GWT_REPO_HOME=/srv/repos
```
2. Load `gwt` into your current shell
```sh
~ $ source /path/to/gwt
```

### Usage

#### List all worktrees in all repositories

```sh
~ $ gwt
